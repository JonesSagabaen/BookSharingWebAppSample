BookSharingWebAppSample
=======================

A sample web application using a Java web framework.  

The components used:
• Apache Tomcat
• Hibernate
• JDBC
• mySQL
• Apache Ant

Tomcat allows the use of .jsp (JavaServer Pages) so that logic can utilize Java's object-oriented design.  
Hibernate acts as the middle ground for these objects to be mapped to the SQL tables and elements.  Ant tasks are 
composed so that the SQL database can be constructed and populated with data from a clean setup 
(this sample project does not include these files).
